    """Documentation
    The environment direct inherits OpenAI Gym API with these additional functions:
        1) explicit train/eval mode change
        2) explicit tell if the env is continuous
        3) maintain n_obs = observation shape,
                    n_act = action space dimension (or number of actions for discrete env)
           note!! one important thing here is to always use int-type n_obs if the observation
           is supposed to be a vector, because later we will assmue any env with n_obs in a
           tuple shape should be mathced with a CNN model rather than a MLP model
    
    We modify the action space so that:
        1) action \in [1, N] for a discrete environment
        2) action \in [-1, 1]^d for a continuous environment
    unless an additional declarification is made
    And we expect to get a one-dimensional numpy array as the input to the step method
